# The Simple JS Calculator
This is a simple calculator done as a project task


<p>The calculator application performs basic arithmetic operations and includes a unique BMI calculator feature. The JavaScript logic handles user input, stores operands and operations in a queue, and computes results sequentially. The BMI calculator prompts users for their height and weight, then calculates and displays the BMI.</p>

<p>Challenges included ensuring multiple operations were correctly handled and managing user input efficiently. To overcome these, the application was structured to maintain an operations queue and clear inputs appropriately. The BMI calculator required input validation to prevent errors, which was managed through prompt dialogs and conditional checks.</p>
