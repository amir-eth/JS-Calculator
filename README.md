             #The Simple JS Calculator
This is a simple calculator done as a project task.

<p>The calculator performs basic arithmetic and includes a BMI calculator. JavaScript handles user input, manages an operations queue, and computes results. The BMI feature validates height and weight inputs to prevent errors.<p>

<p>Challenges included handling multiple operations and user input efficiently, which were addressed through an operations queue and input management.<p>

<p>The design is minimalistic to reduce clutter and includes a dark mode feature for those who are enthusiastic about it,including me.<p>
